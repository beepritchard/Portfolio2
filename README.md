# Portfolio1

## To be Employer Competitive:
    *** Steps to take ***
    • Portfolio with 3+ deployed projects
    • Attention-grabbing: template is fine, but customize and add your personality
    • Deployed projects - link to both the deployed project AND the Github repo
    • Link a PDF of your resume to your site
    • Github: 200+ commits, refactor previously submitted code
    • Contribute regularly to open source projects
    • 3-6 pinned repositories, all of which have professional titles
